# Balck Jack Game by Arafat Rahaman & Aiah Aly

# Hey guys, my partner and I decided for our final project for our CIS 1051, Introductory to Python class, we would attempt to create Black Jack, and this how it went...

# Original Goal:
# Our original goal was to go all out. We were hungry, young, and ambitious CS students that wanted most to blow the roof of our wonderful professor and TA's. We decided what       better game then the infamous Black Jack to do that. We wanted to create a full out GUI that allowed for the game to be fully played just on the GUI. In essense, you could play   the game by simply entering the bet amount in an input box, and the game would be simulated, and the cards would fly out of the deck one-by-one. We envisioned buttons that you     could press to "hit", "stand", or "play again!". In the best cases of senarios we even wanted music and cool animations. Alas, as ambitious as we were, we may have been just a  little too ambitous
