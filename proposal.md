# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Black Jack

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A user will be able to play black jack against a computer, where there cards will be visulized via a GUI.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The black jack game will use a GUI to simulate a game between the player and a computer. The player will be able to run the program and a GUI will pop up. In this GUI, there will be a virtual bank, where the user is given an in-game money of $1000. They can bet whatever amount of the $1000 to play against the computer. The game will be running on a loop until the user runs out of money. The player will be asked they would like to play again.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Before the final project deadline we hope that we will have a accurately functioning blackjack game with a GUI implemented to output images of the cards. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding a dealer and shuffler with animation on top of the better outcome.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope that we can apply some form of animation to the game as well as backgroud music.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to create the best possible software, skills we need to acquire include how to create a GUI. We will need to study skills relating to how to build and operate a GUI as well as how to incorporate all of the card images into the software. Another topic we would need to research is how to input music and animations into a code using Python. My partner and I will be meeting outside of class to work on the code together, we will be working on all of it together as we are both learning. We plan on having the basic blackjack game shell built with the images and then building on top of that from there.
